# glean-sources
Right now, [glean](http://github.com/glean/glean) only supports "core"
repositories from the "glean" GitHub organization.

If you've got a dataset that you would like included in core, file an issue
here.

In the future, I hope to support contrib and user sources repositories outside
the "glean" GitHub organization and direct URLs to repositories.
